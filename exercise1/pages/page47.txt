admin re® generated gross cash of  
USD 543 million in 2015 compared  
to USD 945 million in the prior year.  
The 2015 result includes the positive 
impact of USD 231 million primarily  
from updates to UK annuitant mortality 
assumptions and USD 80 million  
from the UK half year statutory  
valuation. The 2014 result included  
USD 217 million from the sale of aurora 
and USD 225 million release of surplus 
reserves held against the risk of credit 
default. in addition, the prior year 
included USD 234 million following  
the finalisation of the UK statutory 
valuations. a dividend of  
USD 401 million was paid  
to the Group in June 2015. 

admin re® reported net income of  
USD 422 million in 2015 compared to 
USD 34 million in 2014. The 2014 result 
included a USD 203 million loss from  
the sale of aurora. excluding this loss, 
the 2014 net income would have been  
USD 237 million. The increase in the 
current year was driven by higher 
realised gains from sales of government 
bonds as part of the preparation for 
Solvency ii and tax credits following the 
finalisation of the UK year-end statutory 
results and changes to the UK 
corporation tax rate.

Investment result
The return on investments was 4.7%  
for 2015 compared to 4.6% for 2014, 
reflecting a lower average invested asset 
base, which more than offset the impact 
of the decrease in the investment result  
of USD 156 million. The decrease in the 
investment result was mainly attributable 
to a reduced asset base, following the 
sale of aurora.

net investment income of  
USD 656 million in 2015 was lower  
than USD 901 million in 2014 mainly  
due to the net asset outflows related  
to the sale of aurora and the impact  
of foreign exchange rate movements.  
The fixed income running yield was  
3.6% in the reporting period. net realised 
gains were USD 264 million in 2015 
compared to USD 175 million in 2014,  
as the current period included additional 
net realised gains from sales of 
government bonds related to the 
preparation for Solvency ii.

insurance-related investment results are

Expenses 
expenses were USD 320 million in 2015 
compared to USD 359 million in 2014. 
admin re® delivered against its strategy 
with cost reductions in 2015 and lower 
deal-related costs.

Shareholdersʼ equity
common shareholders’ equity at  
the end of 2015 was USD 4.9 billion  
or USD 1.5 billion lower than as of  
31 December 2014. The decrease  
was mainly due to dividends paid to the 
Group and a USD 1.0 billion decrease in 
unrealised gains, driven by increasing 
interest rates in the UK and the US during 
2015, partially offset by net income.

The return on equity was 7.5% for 2015, 
compared to 0.6% for 2014. The 2014 
result included the loss following the  
sale of aurora. excluding this loss,  

the return on equity would have been 
3.8% for 2014. The year-on-year increase  
was mainly due to higher net income  
and lower average equity in 2015.
