Investment result – unit-linked and with-profit business
For unit-linked contracts, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder. For with-profit contracts, the majority of the investment 
risk is also borne by the policyholder, although there are certain guarantees that limit the down-side risk for the policyholder,  
and a certain proportion of the returns may be retained by the Group (typically 10%).

Net investment result on unit-linked and with-profit business credited to policyholders was as follows:

USD millions
Investment income – fixed income securities

Total investment income – unit-linked and with-profit business
Realised gains/losses – fixed income securities

Impairment on fixed income securities related to credit losses
Other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities are bifurcated between credit and non-credit components, with the credit 
component recognised through earnings and the non-credit component recognised in other comprehensive income. The credit 
component of other-than-temporary impairments is defined as the difference between a security’s amortised cost basis and the 
present value of expected cash flows. Methodologies for measuring the credit component of impairment are aligned to market 
observer forecasts of credit performance drivers. Management believes that these forecasts are representative of median  
market expectations.

For securitised products, a cash flow projection analysis is conducted by integrating forward-looking evaluation of collateral 
performance drivers, including default rates, prepayment rates and loss severities, and deal-level features, such as credit 
enhancement and prioritisation among tranches for payments of principal and interest. Analytics are differentiated by asset 
class, product type and security-level differences in historical and expected performance. For corporate bonds and hybrid  
debt instruments, an expected loss approach based on default probabilities and loss severities expected in the current and  
forecasted economic environment is used for securities identified as credit-impaired to project probability-weighted cash  
flows. Expected cash flows resulting from these analyses are discounted, and the present value is compared to the amortised  
cost basis to determine the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments.

A reconciliation of other-than-temporary impairments related to credit losses recognised in earnings was as follows:
