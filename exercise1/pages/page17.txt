growth, 2015 (est.)

Interest rates 
The monetary policies of the major 
central banks remained accommodative, 
but diverged according to their different 
economic growth rates. The european 
central Bank (ecB) and the BoJ 
continued their quantitative easing 
programmes as eurozone and Japanese 
economies were still fragile and deflation 
remained a risk. in contrast, the US 
Federal reserve Board (the US Fed) 
moved towards monetary policy 
normalisation and finally increased the 
target range for the federal funds rate  
in December.

Market expectations for the interest rate 
hike kept yields for US and UK ten-year 
government bonds about 1.5 percentage 
points above German and Japanese bond 
yields. Despite the start of monetary 
policy normalisation in the US, interest 
rates remained historically low in the 
advanced economies (including the US).

in an attempt to contain inflation and to 
stop the depreciation of the real, Brazil 
increased its interest rate to double digits, 
while china and india both reduced rates.

Stock market performance 
Global stock market performance was 
mixed: the US S&P 500 was down 1%, 
the Swiss Market index 2% and the MSci 
UK 6%. The Japanese TOPiX was up 8% 
and the euro Stoxx 50 4% (see stock 
markets chart). after three years in which 
major markets ended in positive territory, 
equity market development slowed down 
due to increased uncertainty, weak profit 
growth and investors caution.

investor risk aversion was driven by 
concerns of reform fatigue in the 
eurozone, instability in iraq and Syria and 
uncertainties about the effect, especially 
on emerging markets, of the interest  
rate hike by the US Fed. investors were  
also concerned about declining growth 
prospects in china and the sluggish 
growth of global trade.
