in line with the ssT, the group measures 
its total risk capital requirement at  
the 99% shortfall (tail VaR) level.  
This represents an estimate of the 
average annual loss likely to occur with  
a frequency of less than once in one 
hundred years, thus capturing the 
potential for severe, but rare, aggregate 
losses.

in addition, the model is used to 
calculate value at risk (VaR) measures 
including 99.5% VaR, which is used  
in other regulatory regimes such as 
solvency ii. 99.5% VaR represents the 
loss likely to be exceeded in only one 
year out of two hundred and is thus 
more severe than the 99% VaR measure, 
which estimates the loss likely to  
be exceeded in one year out of one 
hundred. 

swiss Re’s risk model assesses the 
potential economic loss at a specific 
confidence level. There is thus a 
possibility that actual losses may exceed 
the selected threshold. in addition, the 
reliability of the model may be limited 

when future conditions are difficult  
to predict. For this reason, the model  
and its parameters are continuously 
reviewed and updated to reflect 
changes in the risk environment and 
current best practice. in addition, the 
group complements its risk models by 
ensuring a sound understanding of the 
underlying risks within the company  
and by applying robust internal controls.

in November, the luxembourg regulator 
approved our internal model to be  
used for our legal entities in continental 
Europe, which report under the 
solvency ii regime. 

A major enhancement in 2015 was  
the development of a new model  
for European winter storm risk.  
This proprietary model is used for 
underwriting, business steering and  
risk management purposes. it draws on 
state-of-the-art research and technology 
with a particular emphasis on expanding 
the knowledge of historical winter 
storms over the past 140 years.

Risk modelling  
and risk measures

swiss Re uses a proprietary integrated 
risk model to determine the economic 
capital required to support the risks on 
the company’s books, as well as to 
allocate risk-taking capacity to the 
different lines of business. The group’s 
internal risk model provides a 
meaningful assessment of the risks to 
which the company is exposed and  
is an important tool for managing the 
business. it is used for determining 
capital requirements for internal 
purposes as well as for regulatory 
reporting under the swiss solvency  
Test (ssT) and solvency ii for our legal 
entities in continental Europe. The model 
provides the basis for capital cost 
allocation in swiss Re’s Economic Value 
management (EVm) framework, which 
is used for pricing, profitability evaluation 
and compensation decisions  
(see pages 55–56 for further 
information on EVm).

swiss Re’s internal model is based on 
two important principles. First, it applies 
an asset-liability management approach, 
which measures the net impact of risk 
on the economic value of both assets 
and liabilities. second, it adopts an 
integrated perspective, recognising that 
a single risk factor can affect different 
sub-portfolios and that different risk 
factors can have mutual dependencies.

The model generates a probability 
distribution for the group’s economic 
profit and loss over a one-year time 
horizon, specifying the likelihood that 
the outcome will fall within a given 
range. The risk measures derived from 
the model are expressed as economic 
loss severities taken from the total 
economic profit and loss distribution.
