Risk management

The group’s risk-taking is steered by  
our risk appetite and risk tolerance  
(see swiss Re’s risk appetite framework 
below). 

While the risk appetite guides what  
types of risk the group aims to write, risk 
tolerance is an expression of the extent  
to which the group Board of directors has 

authorised the group Executive 
Committee (group EC) and Business Unit 
management teams to assume risk.  
Risk tolerance criteria are specified for  
the group and Business Units, as well  
as for swiss Re’s major legal entities. 
Furthermore, swiss Re uses a limit 
framework to limit its risk exposure 
accumulations at different levels.

Swiss Re’s risk appetite framework
Our risk appetite framework establishes 
the overall approach through which we 
practice controlled risk-taking through-
out the group. The framework is set out 
in our Group Risk Policy and consists 
of two inter-linked components: 

facilitates discussions about where and 
how the group should deploy its capital, 
liquidity and other resources under a 
risk-return view, while the risk tolerance 
sets clear boundaries to risk-taking.  

 ̤ Risk appetite provides guiding 

principles on acceptable risks and 
describes the aggregate level and 
types of risk that we wish to take or 
avoid in pursuit of the group’s 
strategy. 

 ̤ Risk tolerance represents the 

aggregate amount of risk that the 
group is willing to accept within the 
constraints imposed by its capital 
and liquidity resources, strategy, risk 
appetite and regulatory and rating 
agency requirements.

The risk appetite framework plays a 
particularly important role in the context 
of business strategy and planning 
discussions: the risk appetite statement

during strategic planning and 
target-setting, Risk management 
provides an opinion on the proposed 
strategy and targets to the group EC 
and ultimately the group Board of 
directors. The opinion focuses on the 
risk impact of the proposed strategy 
and the risks related to its 
implementation. The strategic plan, risk 
appetite and capital allocation ambition 
are expressed in a target portfolio for 
the group’s assets and liabilities, which 
should ultimately deliver the group’s 
targeted performance. 

in the context of the annual planning 
process, ie during the phase  
of operational and financial planning, 
Risk management reviews  
and challenges plan assumptions and

assesses the risks and feasibility related 
to implementing the proposed plan.  
it provides transparency on the detailed 
risk implications of the plan and tests  
its adherence to risk appetite and risk 
tolerance. 

in addition, Risk management  
proposes risk capacity limits that  
ensure compliance with the overall  
risk appetite and tolerance. The risk 
capacity limits represent an aggregated 
constraint to risk-taking and seek to 
ensure that group-wide accumulation 
risks remain within acceptable levels. 
They allow for risk monitoring and 
hence also for risk controlling during  
the subsequent execution of the plan.  
in addition to the risk capacity limits 
proposed by Risk management, the 
group EC also sets operational limits, 
which the business monitors and 
controls in day-to-day management.
