Performance 
net income was USD 340 million in 
2015, an increase of 6.6% compared  
to USD 319 million in 2014. The 2015  
result was driven by continued profitable 
business performance across most lines 
of business and investment activities.

Net premiums earned 
net premiums were USD 3.4 billion  
in 2015, a decrease of 1.9% compared  
to 2014, driven by the challenging  
market, most notably in property in 
north america and latin america,  
and foreign exchange rate movements.  
at constant exchange rates, net 
premiums increased by 1.7%. Gross 
premiums written and premiums for 
insurance in derivative form, net of 
internal fronting for the reinsurance 
Business Unit, decreased 7.9%,  
or 4.3% at constant exchange rates,  
to USD 3.9 billion in 2015 compared  
to USD 4.2 billion in 2014.

Combined ratio
The combined ratio increased  
by 0.8 percentage point to 93.8%  
in 2015 compared to 93.0% in 2014, 
impacted by higher large man-made 
losses and higher expenses as a result  
of investment in long-term growth.  

The quality of the book remained 
consistently high year on year,  
with better than expected natural  
catastrophe experience.

Lines of business
The property combined ratio for 2015 
improved by 4.1 percentage points to 
77.0%, reflecting continued profitable 
business performance in most regions 
and lower large loss frequency compared 
to 2014. Both periods benefited  
from the absence of major natural  
catastrophe losses.

The casualty combined ratio improved  
by 6.6 percentage points to 104.1% in 
2015, mainly due to successful business 
growth and favourable prior-year 
development on liability business in 
north america, partially offset by two 
large man-made losses.

The credit combined ratio increased  
to 91.1% in 2015 compared to 72.3%  
in 2014, driven by large surety losses  
in latin america and asia.

in other specialty lines, the combined 
ratio deteriorated by 9.6 percentage 
points to 110.2% in 2015, mainly due  
to large aviation and satellite losses.
