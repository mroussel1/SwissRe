Outlook
Overall, the outlook for 2016 is one of 
moderate growth, but financial market 
risks remain skewed to the downside. 
central bank policy divergence will 
remain a key theme as the US and UK  
are expected to begin raising policy rates, 
while the european central Bank (ecB) 
and Bank of Japan (BoJ) are expected  
to extend their quantitative easing 
programmes. The US Federal reserve 
(US Fed) and Bank of england (Boe)  
have emphasised that the path of  
rate increases will be very gradual,  
as inflationary pressure will remain  
fairly muted and will occur against the 
backdrop of steadily slowing emerging 
market economies (including china).  
The UK has the additional headwind  
of the referendum on its membership  
in the eU. Depending on the outcome,  
this could remain a key theme for the  
UK and europe over the coming years. 

against this backdrop, the Group will seek 
to maintain a balanced and high-quality 
investment portfolio. The acquisition  
of Guardian Financial Services is  
expected to increase the Group’s overall  
allocation to credit by approximately  
6%, consistent with the change in  
admin re®’s investment portfolio and 
business mix. The quality of the credit 
portfolio remains high.

Investment result
The Group’s investment portfolio, 
excluding unit-linked and with-profit 
investments, decreased to 
USD 116.8 billion at the end of 2015, 
compared to USD 125.4 billion at the 
end of 2014. The decrease was due  
to the impact of rising interest rates, 
net asset outflows and foreign 
exchange translation. 

The return on investments for 2015 
was 3.5%, compared to 3.7% in 2014, 
with the decrease mainly attributable 
to lower net investment income from 
equity-accounted investments.

The Group’s non-participating net 
investment income decreased to  
USD 3.4 billion in 2015 compared  
to USD 4.1 billion in 2014, largely 
driven by net asset outflows, reducing 
the size of the fixed income portfolio, 
as well as lower earnings from equity-
accounted positions. The Group’s fixed 
income running yield of 3.0% was 
lower than 3.3% for 2014, driven by 
recent net purchases in a lower yield 
environment, net outflows of higher 
yielding assets and a lower impact 
from extraordinary paydowns.

The Group reported non-participating 
net realised investment gains of  
USD 1.2 billion in 2015, mainly as  
a result of gains from sales of fixed 
income and equity securities, as well  
as gains on insurance-related items.  
The result was significantly higher  
than USD 567 million in 2014, which  
was impacted by the unwinding of an 
asset-funding structure in life & Health 
reinsurance and the sale of aurora  
in admin re®. 

The total return on investments was flat  
in 2015, reflecting the impact of rising 
interest rates and credit spread widening 
over the year.
