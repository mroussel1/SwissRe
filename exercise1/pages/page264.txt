2  Since the Board of Directors’ proposal for allocation of disposable profit, included in the Annual Report 2014, the number of registered shares eligible for dividend, at the dividend 
payment date of 27 April 2015, increased due to the transfer of 1 180 649 shares for employee participation purposes from not eligible to eligible for dividend. This resulted in a 
higher dividend of CHF 9 million, compared to the Board of Directors’ proposal, and in lower legal reserves from capital contributions by the same amount.
3  The Board of Directors’ proposal to the Annual General Meeting of 22 April 2016, is subject to the actual number of shares outstanding and eligible for dividend.

Dividend
If the Board of Directors’ proposal for allocations and dividend payment is accepted, an ordinary dividend of CHF 4.60 per share 
will be paid on 28 April 2016 from voluntary profit reserves.
