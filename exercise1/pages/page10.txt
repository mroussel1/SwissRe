A solid foundation

8  Swiss Re 2015 Financial Report

Dear shareholders,
Since Swiss Re was founded in 1863,  
we have managed risk and absorbed 
extreme events in many forms. From 
earthquakes to terrorism, we have 
enabled society to thrive and progress. 
However, protection alone is not  
enough — resilience is our ultimate goal. 
This vision permeates our daily actions 
and continues to inform our strategy. 

It also contributed to our success in 
2015: I am very pleased to report that  
we managed to navigate the challenging 
environment and can report another 
positive set of results, driven by strong 
performances from all three of our 
Business Units. Group net income 
reached USD 4.6 billion — one of our 
highest ever — up from USD 3.5 billion  
in 2014. These results clearly 
differentiate us in the industry. With  
the updated strategic framework  
we unveiled in December 2015, we  
believe we are well placed to continue  
to focus on profitable growth, strong 
capitalisation and unique client 
experience.
