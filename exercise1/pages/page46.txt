Financial year

Admin Re®
in 2015 admin re® made a strong 
contribution to the Group and delivered 
against its strategy. Since 1 January 2016  
it has become part of life capital.

Strategy and priorities
as part of life capital from 
1 January 2016, admin re® aims to 
enhance profitability by leveraging its 
core competencies of selective growth, 
value extraction and operational 
excellence.

admin re®’s strategy of selective growth 
means pursuing opportunities to build 
and enhance the franchise in the UK 
market. all transactions need to meet 
Swiss re’s Group investment criteria  
and hurdle rates.

Value extraction relates to the active 
management of the portfolios of assets 
and blocks of businesses and a focus  
on consistently creating value through 
capital and tax synergies.

Operational excellence involves 
continuous improvement of the operating 
platform. it also means focusing on 
transformation and management actions, 
including business efficiency and cost 
reductions.

For future periods, admin re® will be 
reported as part of the life capital 
Business Unit.

Performance
admin re® announced the acquisition  
of Guardian Financial Services 
(Guardian) in September 2015,  
which closed in January 2016 following 
regulatory approval. The acquisition  
is a strong demonstration of progress 
against admin re®’s strategy to be a 
leading closed life book consolidator in 
the UK. The sale of aurora national life 
assurance company (aurora) closed in 
april 2015, continuing admin re®’s exit 
from the US market; in the third quarter, 
HSBc policies were successfully 
migrated to admin re® platforms.

“at admin re® we achieved 
a strong performance 
across all metrics.”
