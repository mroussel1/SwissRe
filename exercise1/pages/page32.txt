Strengthening the role of long-term investors

Unprecedented official policies have 
helped to restore financial market 
stability. However, more than seven years 
after the financial crisis it is questionable 
whether the benefits still outweigh the 
costs, such as asset bubbles, economic 
inequality, reputational damage for 
central banks and a “tax” on savers. 
Swiss re has identified three policy areas 
where reform could mitigate these effects 
and significantly enhance the long-term 
growth outlook. 

The first is to strengthen private capital 
market intermediation. in the eU up to 
80% of financial intermediation takes 
place through banks, which due to 
regulatory pressure have been reducing 
their balance sheets. This directly  
impacts their ability to lend, with clear 
implications for growth. Furthermore,  
the significant central bank holdings  
of various debt securities has created 
significant price distortions. 

The second area is public sector support 
for the development of tradeable asset 
classes, specifically in relation to 
infrastructure investing. in 2013 just  
24% of infrastructure finance was 
through tradeable project bonds with  
the rest in illiquid bank loans. Greater 
emphasis on project bonds in tradeable 
form, achieved with standardisation,  
as well as strengthening investor rights  
more generally to tackle well-known 
policy risks, would significantly enhance 
accessibility of the asset class.

Finally, a conducive regulatory and policy 
environment would allow long-term 
investors to exert their natural role of 
acting as a financial market stabilizer  
and channel funds to the real economy. 
Policymakers need to prevent  
short-termism and support economic 
growth and job creation. The table below 
shows that long-term investors hold 
assets worth 91% of global GDP, giving 
them the potential to be key financiers  
of growth and development projects.
