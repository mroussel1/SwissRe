admin re® reported net income of  
USD 422 million for 2015, compared to 
USD 34 million for 2014, driven mainly 
by higher realised gains, favourable  
UK linked investment performance  
and one-off tax benefits, partially offset  
by costs for the acquisition of Guardian 
Financial Services. The 2014 result was 
impacted by the loss of USD 203 million 
on the sale of aurora national life 
assurance company (aurora).

life & Health reinsurance premiums 
earned and fee income were 
USD 11.0 billion, compared to 
USD 11.3 billion in 2014. at constant 
exchange rates, premiums and fees 
increased by 6.1%. The operating margin 
for life & Health reinsurance was 9.9% 
in 2015, compared to 2.6% in 2014, 
mainly reflecting the improvement  
in operating income in both life and  
health segments.

common shareholders’ equity, excluding 
non-controlling interests and the impact 
of contingent capital instruments, 
decreased to USD 32.4 billion at the  
end of 2015 from USD 34.8 billion at  
the end of 2014. The decrease was due 
to the distribution of the 2014 regular  
and special dividends of USD 2.6 billion,  
the launch of the share buy-back 
programme in mid-november,  
unrealised losses on fixed income 
securities and unfavourable foreign 
exchange rate movements, partially 
offset by higher net income. Book  
value per common share decreased  
to USD 95.98 or cHF 96.04 at the  
end of 2015 compared to USD 101.78  
(cHF 101.12) 12 months earlier.  
return on equity increased to 13.7%  
for 2015 from 10.5% for 2014.

Business performance
Premiums earned and fee income for  
the Group totalled USD 30.2 billion  
for 2015, compared to USD 31.3 billion  
for 2014, mainly reflecting unfavourable 
foreign exchange rate movements.  
at constant exchange rates, premiums 
and fees increased by 3.7%. 

Premiums earned by Property & casualty 
reinsurance in 2015 were 
USD 15.1 billion, compared to 
USD 15.6 billion in the same period  
last year. at constant exchange rates, 
premiums earned increased by 3.4%, 
driven by increased premiums in casualty 
and specialty, partly offset by decreases 
in property. The Property & casualty 
reinsurance combined ratio was 86.0% 
in 2015, compared to 83.7% in 2014. 
Both periods benefited from a better  
than expected natural catastrophe 
experience and favourable prior-year 
reserve developments.

corporate Solutions premiums earned 
were USD 3.4 billion. at constant 
exchange rates, premiums earned 
increased by 1.7%. The corporate 
Solutions combined ratio was 93.8%  
in 2015, compared to 93.0% in 2014, 
impacted by higher large man-made 
losses.

admin re® generated gross cash of 
USD 543 million in 2015, down from 
USD 945 million in 2014. Gross cash 
generation in 2015 was driven by  
UK assumption updates, primarily to 
annuitant mortality rates, and by the  
UK half-year valuation. The 2014 
amount included a release of  
USD 225 million in surplus reserves  
held against the risk of credit default,  
a one-time benefit of USD 234 million 
following the finalisation of the 2013 
year-end UK statutory valuation and 
proceeds of USD 217 million from the 
sale of aurora.

Investment result and expenses
The return on investments was 3.5%  
for 2015, compared to 3.7% for 2014,  
with the decrease mainly attributable  
to lower net investment income from 
equity-accounted investments.

The Group’s non-participating net 
investment income was USD 3.4 billion 
for 2015, compared to USD 4.1 billion 
for 2014. The decrease mainly related  
to net asset outflows and lower market 
value gains on equity-accounted 
investments. The Group’s fixed income 
running yield for 2015 was 3.0%, 
compared to 3.3% for 2014.

The Group reported non-participating 
net realised investment gains of 
USD 1.2 billion for 2015, compared to 
USD 567 million for 2014. The current 
period result was primarily driven by 
sales of government bonds and equity 
securities, partly offset by impairments.

acquisition costs for the Group slightly 
decreased to USD 6.4 billion in 2015.  
at constant foreign exchange rates, 
acquisition costs increased by 4.0%  
due to a higher share of proportional 
business written. 

Other expenses were USD 3.3 billion in 
2015, a slight increase from the previous 
period, fully accounted for by the release 
of a premium tax provision in asia in the 
third quarter of 2014.

interest expenses amounted to 
USD 579 million in 2015, down from 
USD 721 million in 2014, mainly due  
to the unwinding of an asset funding 
structure supporting a longevity 
transaction in life & Health reinsurance 
in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The Group reported a tax charge of 
USD 651 million on a pre-tax income  
of USD 5.3 billion for 2015, compared to  
a charge of USD 658 million on a pre-tax 
income of USD 4.2 billion for 2014.  
This translated into an effective tax rate 
in the current and prior-year reporting 
periods of 12.2% and 15.6%, 
respectively. The lower tax rate in  
2015 was largely driven by a tax benefit 
arising from a local statutory accounting 
adjustment for restructuring of 
subsidiaries, higher tax benefits from 
foreign currency translation differences 
between statutory and US GaaP 
accounts, and the release of valuation 
allowances partially offset by tax on 
profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions.
