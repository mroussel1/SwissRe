Cautionary note  
on forward-looking statements

Certain statements and illustrations 
contained herein are forward-looking. 
these statements (including as to plans, 
objectives, targets and trends) and 
illustrations provide current expectations 
of future events based on certain 
assumptions and include any statement 
that does not directly relate to a historical 
fact or current fact.

forward-looking statements typically 
are identified by words or phrases  
such as “anticipate”, “assume”, “believe”, 
“continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, 
“foresee”, “intend”, “may increase” and 
“may fluctuate” and similar expressions 
or by future or conditional verbs such  
as “will”, “should”, “would” and “could”. 
these forward-looking statements 
involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and other factors, which 
may cause Swiss Re’s actual results of 
operations, financial condition, solvency 
ratios, capital or liquidity positions or 
prospects to be materially different from 
any future results of operations, financial 
condition, solvency ratios, capital  
or liquidity positions or prospects 
expressed or implied by such statements 
or cause Swiss Re to not achieve its 
published targets.

Such factors include, among others:

 ̤ instability affecting the global  

financial system and developments 
related thereto;

 ̤ deterioration in global economic 

conditions;

 ̤ Swiss Re’s ability to maintain sufficient 
liquidity and access to capital markets, 
including sufficient liquidity to cover 
potential recapture of reinsurance 
agreements, early calls of debt or 
debt-like arrangements and collateral 
calls due to actual or perceived 
deterioration of Swiss Re’s financial 
strength or otherwise;

 ̤ the effect of market conditions, 

including the global equity and credit 
markets, and the level and volatility  
of equity prices, interest rates, credit 
spreads, currency values and other 
market indices, on Swiss Re’s 
investment assets;

 ̤ changes in Swiss Re’s investment 
result as a result of changes in its 
investment policy or the changed 
composition of its investment assets, 
and the impact of the timing of any 
such changes relative to changes  
in market conditions;

 ̤ uncertainties in valuing credit default 

swaps and other credit-related 
instruments;

 ̤ possible inability to realise amounts  
on sales of securities on Swiss Re’s 
balance sheet equivalent to their 
mark-to-market values recorded for 
accounting purposes;

 ̤ the outcome of tax audits, the ability 

to realise tax loss carryforwards  
and the ability to realise deferred tax 
assets (including by reason of the mix 
of earnings in a jurisdiction or deemed 
change of control), which could 
negatively impact future earnings;

 ̤ the possibility that Swiss Re’s hedging 

arrangements may not be effective;

 ̤ the lowering or loss of one of the 
financial strength or other ratings  
of one or more Swiss Re companies, 
and developments adversely  
affecting Swiss Re’s ability to achieve 
improved ratings;

 ̤ the cyclicality of  

the reinsurance industry;
