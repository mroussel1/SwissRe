Financial year
corporate Solutions

Shareholders’ equity
common shareholdersʼ equity remained 
stable at USD 2.3 billion since the end of 
2014, with a USD 200 million dividend 
paid to the Group, offset by net income 
for the year. The return on equity was 
14.8% in 2015, compared to 12.5%  
in 2014.

Outlook
Prices for commercial insurance are 
under significant pressure, with a 
growing number of segments  
operating at unattractive rate levels. 
corporate Solutions has maintained its 
commitment to underwriting discipline 
while achieving its return on equity 
ambition for 2015. corporate Solutions 
believes that it is well positioned to 
successfully navigate an increasingly 
challenging market thanks to its value 
proposition, strong balance sheet and 
selective underwriting approach, but is 
not fully insulated from the general 
market environment.

Investment result
The return on investments for 2015  
was 3.0% compared to 2.6% in 2014, 
reflecting an increase in the net 
investment income of USD 36 million  
and net realised gains of USD 13 million.

net investment income increased to  
USD 149 million in 2015 compared to 
USD 113 million in 2014, in part due to 
business growth and an ensuing increase 
in the investment portfolio. net realised 
gains were USD 107 million in 2015 
compared to USD 94 million in 2014,  
as the current year included additional 
net realised gains on sales of equity 
securities.

insurance-related derivative results  
are not included in the investment  
figures above.

corporate Solutions offers insurance 
protection against weather perils and 
other risks, which are accounted for as 
derivatives. The insurance in derivative 
form reported net realised gains of  
USD 33 million in 2015 compared  
to USD 53 million in 2014. The 2015  
period was impacted by mild weather  
in December.
