Currency movements
The ecB’s announcement of a 
quantitative easing programme and 
fears about the stability of the eurozone 
caused the euro to depreciate against 
the US dollar and other major currencies 
during the first quarter of the year.  
The Swiss franc appreciated strongly 
after the Swiss national Bank (SnB) 
removed the exchange rate floor of 
1.20 francs per euro in January.  
against the background of slower 
growth, persistent pressure on the 
export industry and the divergence 
between spot and forward exchange 
rates, the People’s Bank of china (PBoc) 
devalued the chinese renminbi to 
around 6.4 per US dollar in august, 
surprising the markets. against the 
US dollar, the renminbi, euro, pound  
and Swiss franc ended the year down 
4%, 10%, 6% and 1% respectively,  
while the yen remained unchanged.

Economic risks affecting re/insurers 
Many risks could derail global growth  
and adversely impact financial markets  
and re/insurers.

concerns remain about the effect of  
US monetary policy normalisation on 
emerging markets. in recent years, their 
economies have been supported by rapid 
credit growth (especially in the private 
sector) due to inexpensive and abundant 
domestic and external liquidity. Higher 
interest rates in the US and a subsequent 
reduction in global liquidity now  
may lead to further capital outflows.  
in addition emerging market debt is often 
denominated in US dollars rather than  
in local currencies. a further appreciation  
of the US dollar would therefore cause the 
debt ratios of many countries to increase.
