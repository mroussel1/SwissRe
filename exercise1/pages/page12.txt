Delivering on our targets
Over the last five years, we have  
grown the regular dividend and we  
have executed our internal growth 
initiatives while making sensible 
acquisitions. At the same time we 
distributed excess capital to our 
shareholders and maintained our  
very strong capital position. We have 
successfully reached the return on  
equity (ROE) and earnings per share 
(EPS) targets we set five years ago in 
very different circumstances. This is  
an impressive achievement under any 
conditions, though especially so in light 
of the turbulent markets and uncertain 
macroeconomic conditions that 
prevailed during much of the 2011–2015 
target period. At 9.6%, we almost 
achieved our economic net worth per 
share (ENWPS) average annual growth 
target of 10%, following the previously 
announced agreement to acquire 
Guardian Financial Services.

Our new financial targets
Looking at 2016 and beyond, 
our new Group targets are 
focused on profitability and 
economic growth.

The ‘over the cycle’ 
timeframe provides a long-
term goal, without being 
distorted by outlying years.

The new targets are fully 
consistent with Swiss Re’s 
capital priorities.

Return on equity
At least 700 basis points greater  
than the risk-free rate, as measured  
by ten-year US government bonds.

Economic net worth  
per share
10% growth per annum, using  
year-end Economic Net Worth (ENW) 
plus dividends, divided by previous 
year-end ENW.
