the amount of gross unrecognised tax benefits within the tabular reconciliation that, if recognised, would affect the effective  
tax rate were approximately UsD 539 million and UsD 345 million at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, respectively.

interest and penalties related to unrecognised tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense. such expense in 2015  
was UsD 35 million (UsD 19 million in 2014). as of 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, UsD 112 million and 
UsD 72 million, respectively, were accrued for the payment of interest (net of tax benefits) and penalties. the accrued  
interest balance as of 31 December 2015 is included within the deferred and other non-current taxes section reflected  
in the balance sheet.

the balance of gross unrecognised tax benefits as of 31 December 2015 presented in the table above excludes accrued  
interest and penalties (UsD 72 million).

During the year, certain tax positions and audits in switzerland, france, italy and Germany were effectively settled.

the Group continually evaluates proposed adjustments by taxing authorities. the Group believes that it is reasonably  
possible (more than remote and less than likely) that the balance of unrecognised tax benefits could increase or decrease  
over the next 12 months due to settlements or expiration of statutes. However, quantification of an estimated range cannot  
be made at this time.

the following table summarises jurisdictions and tax years that remain subjects to examination:
