Natural catastrophes  
and climate change

Natural catastrophes are a key risk in 
our property & Casualty (p&C) business. 
The damage caused by floods, storms, 
earthquakes and other natural disasters 
can affect millions of lives and  
the economies of entire countries.  
in 2015, the total worldwide economic 
losses from natural and man-made 
catastrophes were estimated  
at UsD 92 billion – of these, 
UsD 37 billion were insured.

Having access to effective re/insurance 
protection against natural catastrophes 
creates significant benefits for our 
clients – as well as society at large.  
in 2015, we received UsD 2.6 billion of 
p&C reinsurance premiums for natural 
catastrophe covers (for losses larger 
than UsD 20 million); this was 
equivalent to 17% of total premiums  
in this business segment.

The impact of climate change 
on average, both economic and insured 
losses caused by natural catastrophes 
have increased steadily over the past 
20 years. The key reasons have been 
economic development, population 
growth, urbanisation and a higher 
concentration of assets in exposed areas.

This general trend will continue.  
but crucially, losses will be further 
aggravated by climate change. The 
scientific consensus is that a continued 
rise in average global temperatures will 
have a significant effect on weather-
related natural catastrophes. According 
to the special report on Extremes  
(srEX, 2012) and the Fifth Assessment 
report (Ar5, 2014) published by the 
intergovernmental panel on Climate 
Change (ipCC), a changing climate 

gradually leads to shifts in the frequency, 
intensity, spatial extent, duration and 
timing of extreme weather events.

if climate change remains unchecked,  
the relative importance of the main 
drivers will thus gradually shift, with 
climate change accounting for an 
increasingly large share of natural 
catastrophe losses.

in view of the potential impact of climate 
change on our business in the medium- 
to long-term, we made it a priority issue 
more than 20 years ago and formed a 
comprehensive climate change strategy 
with four pillars:
 ̤ Advancing our knowledge and 

understanding of climate change 
risks, quantifying and integrating 
them into our risk management  
and underwriting frameworks  
where relevant;

 ̤ Developing products and services 

to mitigate — or adapt to —  
climate risk;

 ̤ raising awareness about climate 
change risks through dialogue with 
clients, employees and the public,  
and advocacy of a worldwide policy 
framework for climate change;

 ̤ Tackling our own carbon footprint 

and ensuring transparent annual 
emissions reporting.
