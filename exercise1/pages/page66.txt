Risk assessment
Overall risk remained within our risk 
tolerance despite higher financial 
market and credit risk due to inclusion 
of guardian Financial services. 

 ̤ Credit risk was 29% higher at 

Usd 3.4 billion, mainly reflecting the 
additional default and migration risk of 
the corporate bonds acquired with the 
guardian Financial services portfolio.
 ̤ property and casualty risk increased 
by 4% to Usd 9.4 billion, net of risk 
mitigating measures, reflecting growth 
in natural catastrophe business and 
continued reductions in our external 
hedging in the year.

 ̤ life and health risk decreased by 10%  

to Usd 7.2 billion. This drop was 
mainly driven by the depreciation  
of several currencies against the 
Us dollar.

In 2015, Swiss Reʼs overall risk 
increased by 3% mainly driven by 
higher financial market and credit  
risk exposure related to the portfolio  
of Guardian Financial Services  
(see page 51). Property and casualty 
risk also increased while the decrease 
in life and health risk partly alleviated 
the development.

swiss Re’s internal risk model (see box on 
page 70) is used to measure the group’s 
capital requirements and for defining the 
risk tolerance, risk limits, and liquidity 
stress tests. Based on the internal risk 
model, our overall risk exposure in terms 
of 99% tail value at risk (tail VaR) 
increased to Usd 19.6 billion in 2015,  
up 3% from Usd 19.1 billion in 2014. 
99% tail VaR (also known as expected 
shortfall) represents an estimate of the 
average annual unexpected loss likely to 
occur with a frequency of less than once 
in 100 years.

Alternative risk measures — 99% and 
99.5% VaR — showed an increase of our 
risk by 1% to Usd 14.5 billion and by 2% 
to Usd 17.4 billion, respectively.

 

The group capital requirement table on 
page 65 shows the 99% tail VaR on a 
standalone basis for each of swiss Re’s 
core risk categories:
 ̤ Financial market risk increased by 4% 

to Usd 12.6 billion in 2015, mainly 
driven by the additional credit spread 
risk related to the assets of guardian 
Financial services. This is slightly offset 
by the reduction in equity risk 
reflecting negative market movements.
