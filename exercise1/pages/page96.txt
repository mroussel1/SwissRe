Work methods of the Board of 
Directors and its committees
Convening meetings and invitation 
Swiss re’s Board of Directors oversees 
governance, audit, compensation, 
finance and risk, and investment and  
is supported in this responsibility by  
its committees. the full Board and  
its committees meet at the invitation  
of the Chairman of the Board of Directors 
as often as business requires or at least 
quarterly. any member of the Board  
of Directors or the Group eC may, for a 
specific reason, require the Chairman to 
call an extraordinary Board of Directors  
or committee meeting. the members of  
the Board of Directors ensure that they  
are able to fulfil the responsibilities of  
their position even in periods when  
there are increased demands on their 
time. the Chairman defines the agenda 
for each meeting and therefore  
works closely with the chairpersons
