Property & casualty reinsurance

Performance
net income for 2015 was USD 3.0 billion. 
The result reflected solid underwriting 
results supported by benign natural 
catastrophe experience and net reserve 
releases from prior accident years.  
The overall result was impacted by a  
large man-made loss burden, notably the 
explosion in Tianjin, china, estimated to 
impact the property and marine business 
lines by USD 235 million.

The combined ratio was slightly higher  
at 86.0%, compared to 83.7% in 2014.

The underwriting result for 2015 
decreased by USD 433 million largely 
due to the impact of foreign exchange 
rate movements and lower prices for 
reinsurance. This also reflects a shift 
towards more proportional business and 
more casualty business, both of which 
typically result in a higher combined ratio. 
These shifts were partly offset by better 
than expected natural catastrophe 
experience and positive prior-year 
development.

Major natural catastrophes in 2015 
included storms on australia’s east coast, 
storm niklas in europe, a sandstorm in 
Saudi arabia, and floods in india and the 
UK in December. large man-made losses 
included the explosion in Tianjin, china,  
a fire on an oil platform in the Gulf of 
Mexico, a dam burst in Brazil, a credit  
loss in india, an engineering loss in 
France and a fire at a South Korean 
warehouse. 

Net premiums earned
net premiums earned were 
USD 15.1 billion in 2015, compared to 
USD 15.6 billion for 2014. The decrease 
was mainly driven by foreign exchange 
rate movements. at constant exchange 
rates, premiums earned increased by 
USD 497 million, driven by increased 
premiums in casualty and specialty, 
partly offset by decreases in property.

The composition of gross premiums 
earned by region changed year on year, 
with the americas having a higher share 
of premiums in 2015 compared to 2014.

moved towards proportional business in 
2015. Based on gross premiums written 
before intra-Group retrocession, the 
share of proportional business was 69% 
in 2015, compared to 64% in 2014.

Combined ratio 
Property & casualty reinsurance 
reported a solid combined ratio of 
86.0% in 2015, compared to 83.7%  
in the previous year. Both periods 
benefited from a better than expected 
natural catastrophe experience and 
favourable prior-year reserve 
developments.

The impact from natural catastrophes  
in 2015 was 8.7 percentage points 
below the expected level of  
9.9 percentage points. Favourable 
development from prior accident years 
improved the 2015 combined ratio  
by 5.1 percentage points compared  
to 3.9 percentage points in 2014.

Administrative expense ratio
The administrative expense ratio  
increased to 8.3% in 2015, compared  
to 7.5% in 2014. The prior year ratio 

benefited by one percentage point due 
to a release of a premium tax provision  
in asia in the third quarter of 2014.

Lines of business
Property  
The property combined ratio was  
73.1% in 2015, in line with 69.7% in 
2014, supported by benign natural 
catastrophe loss experience and 
favourable prior-year claims experience.

Casualty
The casualty combined ratio for 2015 
was 99.9%, compared to 104.1% in 
2014. This is mainly due to higher net 
reserve releases compared to last year.

Specialty lines 
The specialty combined ratio increased 
to 80.5% in 2015, compared to 68.1%  
in 2014, reflecting the impact of the 
explosion in Tianjin, china, and 
significantly lower net reserve releases 
compared to 2014.
