 

Some progress has been made on these 
issues. in 2015 the Juncker commission 
on capital Markets Union (cMU) 
proposed changes that directly address 
infrastructure investing and securitisation:

 ̤ On securitisation, the cMU  

has proposed a new regulatory 
framework, aimed at rebuilding  
trust in the market and improving  
the financing of the eU economy.

 ̤ On infrastructure, the Solvency ii 

framework for insurance regulation 
has a new concept of ‘qualifying 
infrastructure investments’ for a 
defined set of safer investments. 
These will benefit from a lower capital 
charge, making the asset class more 
attractive for insurers.

While these initiatives are very welcome, 
there remain significant policy changes 
which could help mitigate the effects of 
financial repression and promote a more 
resilient and sustainable growth outlook.
