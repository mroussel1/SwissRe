... to the United Nations
Many of our recent efforts to expand 
insurance protection cover losses  
from natural catastrophes and weather 
volatility (eg drought or excessive 
rainfall). As climate change is predicted 
to increase these losses, such 
transactions also help communities  
to strengthen their climate resilience. 
Furthermore, we have found that 
partnering with public sector clients, 
especially national and regional 
governments, is an effective way  
to develop solutions.

building on these experiences, we 
made a significant commitment to the 
United Nations at its Climate summit in 
september 2014. personally addressing 
the government leaders present at the 
summit, Group CEo Michel M. liès 
made the following pledge: “by the year 
2020, swiss re commits to having 
advised 50 sovereigns and sub-
sovereigns on climate risk resilience, 
and to have offered them UsD 10 billion 
against this risk.”

We have agreed with the United 
Nations to report publicly on the 
progress we make on this commitment. 
by the end of 2015, we had advised  
13 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on 
climate risk resilience and offered them 
a total of UsD 2.1 billion in re/insurance 
protection.

... to the Grow Africa Partnership 
in our efforts to bring risk protection to 
underinsured communities, the African 
continent — sub-saharan Africa in 
particular — has been a focus area  
in recent years. reflecting this 
engagement, we made an important 
commitment to the Grow Africa 

partnership (www.growafrica.org) in 
2012. This initiative was launched by  
a number of organisations to promote 
public-private collaboration and 
investment in African agriculture.  
As most smallholder farmers in 
sub-saharan Africa have lacked  
access to insurance protection so far, 
addressing this problem is crucial to 
protect families’ livelihoods, facilitate 
economic development and reduce 
poverty.

our commitment to the Grow Africa 
partnership thus includes the following 
three elements:
 ̤ Give farmers in sub-saharan Africa 

access to tools such as weather  
and yield index insurance products;

 ̤ invest in resources equivalent to 
about UsD 2 million per year to 
support the development of 
sustainable agricultural risk 
management markets;

 ̤ provide agricultural insurance  
for up to 1.4 million smallholder 
farmers.

Working together with different 
partners, we helped to bring weather 
insurance to 1.6 million smallholder 
farmers in 11 sub-saharan countries  
by the end of 2015. The fact that the 
total has fallen from the 2 million 
recorded in the previous year  
is mainly due to changes in how one 
country participating in the African  
risk Capacity has structured its 
coverage under the programme: it has 
substantially revised its assumptions  
on the drought exposure of its farmers  
and reduced the percentage of farmers 
covered by the scheme.
