At our switzerland headquarters, we 
have committed to a number of actions 
we expect will qualify us for certification 
by the industry-leading EDGE  
(Economic Dividends for Gender Equality) 
organisation. And across the Group,  
we introduced a new Employer brand, 
We're smarter together, which 
emphasises gender-neutral visuals, 
messaging and job advertisements.

The “own the Way you Work” TM 
philosophy has not only become a 
distinctive element of our brand, it also 
plays an important part in our efforts  
to make our offices more flexible and 
productive, and to reduce our energy 
intensity (see “Tackling our carbon 
footprint” on page 119). 

Advancing gender equality is an essential 
part of our Human Capital strategy.  
The initiatives described above support 
this goal by increasing awareness  
of unconscious bias and by fostering 
open-mindedness on how, when and 
where work gets done. This strategic 
component is benefiting both women 
and men, as it helps to improve 
productivity and work/life balance.

With regard to increasing women’s 
representation in management, we have 
recently conducted country-based 
analyses of our talent flows and assessed 
ourselves against external best practices. 
A formal approach is currently being 
developed as part of our Group Talent 
strategy, and progress will be closely 
monitored by the Group Executive 
Committee and the board of Directors.
