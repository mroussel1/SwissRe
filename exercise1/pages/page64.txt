of the group’s overall risk tolerance.

reviews risk capacity limits, monitors 
adherence to risk tolerance, and 
reviews top risk issues and exposures.

the financial risk analysis methodology 
and valuation related to each asset 
class and ensures that the relevant 
management processes and 
controlling mechanisms are in place.

 ̤ The Audit Committee oversees internal 

controls and compliance procedures.

developing and implementing swiss Re’s 
group-wide risk management 
framework. it also sets and monitors risk 
capacity limits, oversees the Economic 
Value management framework (see 
page 55), determines product policy and 
underwriting standards, and manages 

regulatory interactions and legal 
obligations. The group EC has delegated 
various risk management responsibilities 
to the group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) as 
well as to the Business Units.

The group CRO, who is a member of  
the group EC, reports directly to the 
group CEO, and advises the group EC, 
the Chairman or the respective group 
Board Committees, in particular the 
Finance and Risk Committee, on 
significant matters arising in his area of 
responsibility. The group CRO leads the 
group Risk management function, which 
is responsible for risk oversight and 
control across swiss Re. The group Risk 
management function is comprised of 
central risk management units providing 
shared services, along with dedicated 
teams for Reinsurance, Corporate

The three Business Unit risk teams are led 
by dedicated Chief Risk Officers, who
