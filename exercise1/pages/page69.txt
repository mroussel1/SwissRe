1  single event losses with a 200-year return period show for example that there is a 0.5% probability over the next year that the loss from a single Atlantic hurricane event could 
exceed Usd 5.6 billion. The impact excludes earned premiums for the business written and reinstatement premiums that could be triggered as a result of the event.

Description

Developments in 2015

swiss Re’s life and health (l&H) insurance  
risk arises from the business we take  
on when providing mortality (death), 
longevity (annuity), and morbidity (illness 
and disability) coverage through both the 
Reinsurance Business Unit, and when 
acquiring run-off business through  
the Admin Re® (life Capital since 
1 January 2016) Business Unit.  
in addition to potential shock events, such 
as a severe pandemic, we monitor and 
manage underlying risks inherent in life 
and health contracts (eg, pricing and 
reserving risks) that arise when mortality, 
morbidity, or lapse experience deviates 
from expectations. The investment risk 
that is part of some life and health 
business is monitored and managed as 
financial market risk. 

swiss Re’s overall life and health risk 
decreased by 10% to Usd 7.2 billion.  
The decrease was to a large extent driven 
by foreign exchange movements, as the 
depreciation of several currencies (in 
particular the Canadian dollar and 
Australian dollar) against the Us dollar 
had a significant impact on the present 
value of our liabilities.

The decline in the overall l&H shortfall 
was further amplified by a large exposure 
decrease in mortality trend risk (death) 
mainly due to lower mortality 
assumptions and model improvements 
for several markets. This was partly offset 
by higher morbidity (illness and disability) 
and lethal pandemic risk, where we 

Management

To control risk exposure, we have an 
aggregate group limit governing the 
acceptance of all life and health risks, 
with separate individual limits  
for mortality, longevity and lethal  
pandemic risk. 

At the Business Unit level, acceptance  
of life and health risks is governed by 
aggregated Business Unit limits. local 
teams can write reinsurance within their 
allocated capacity and clearly defined 
boundaries. 

market exposure limits, which are 
regularly monitored, are in place for 
catastrophe and stop-loss business.  
We pay particular attention to 
accumulation risk in densely populated 
areas and apply limits for individual 
buildings. 

As in property and casualty, all large, 
complex or unusual transactions  
are reviewed and require individual  
approval from swiss Re’s underwriting,  
client management and risk  
management functions. 

experienced more business. The inclusion 
of the guardian Financial services 
portfolio (see page 51) substantially 
increased our longevity exposure thus 
leading to a further decline in overall l&H 
shortfall, as longevity risk provides a 
natural hedge to some of the mortality 
trend risk (due to diversification).  

The 200-year pandemic event shown in 
the table above remained stable at 
Usd 2.4 billion. 

.

We further manage the risk exposure  
of swiss Re’s life and health book  
by external retrocession and also  
issue insurance-linked securities  
to reduce peak exposures (eg, vita  
bond programme).
