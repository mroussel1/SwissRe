Expanding re/insurance 
protection

Throughout our long history, we have 
provided our clients with financial 
protection against risk. Traditionally, our 
most important client groups are insurers 
and large corporations. We offer them a 
wide range of products covering many 
different types of losses.

However, there remains significant unmet 
demand for effective, commercially viable 
re/insurance protection. As the graph 
below illustrates, the gap between 
insured and uninsured losses remains 
substantial. Given this protection gap,  
we look beyond our established client 
base and traditional business model.  
in particular, we aim to expand  
re/insurance protection by focusing  
on underinsured risks, new markets,  
different clients and innovative risk 
transfer products.

some of the pioneering transactions we 
completed in 2015 are outlined below, 
ranging from large state-subsidised 
insurance funds to pilot projects in 
uncharted territory.

Protecting the Florida Hurricane 
Catastrophe Fund
The state of Florida has over 
UsD 3 trillion of coastal assets, one of  
the highest concentrations anywhere in 
the world. but as the state lies within the 
infamous “hurricane alley,” its population 
faces a latent disaster risk. in response, 
the state-run Florida Hurricane 
Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) established its 
first-ever reinsurance programme in 2015 
and chose swiss re as one of its leaders.

Although ten years have passed since  
a major hurricane last made landfall in 
Florida, the FHCF recognises that it is 
only a matter of time until one strikes 
again. As the 2005 hurricane season 
showed, the financial consequences  
for local insurers, and ultimately 
homeowners, can be severe. it is the  
task of the FHCF to ensure that insurers 
can pay claims from such extreme events  
and to reduce the impact on taxpayers.

This is why the FHCF has purchased 
reinsurance protection for the first  
time in its 22-year history: by adding 
UsD 1 billion of private capital it can 
further build the financial stability it needs 
to ensure Florida’s economic resilience in 
the face of disasters.
