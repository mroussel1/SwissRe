24  Swiss Re 2015 Financial report

Swiss Re reported a strong net 
income of USD 4.6 billion for 2015, 
compared to USD 3.5 billion for 2014. 
Earnings per share were USD 13.44  
or CHF 12.93, up from USD 10.23 
(CHF 9.33) for 2014. All three 
Business Units contributed to this 
result. The underwriting performance 
of Property & Casualty Reinsurance 
and Corporate Solutions remained 
solid, reflecting the high quality  
of those portfolios. Life & Health 
Reinsurance met its return on equity 
target after the management actions 
of 2014. Admin Re® again generated 
significant gross cash for the Group. 

net income for reinsurance was  
USD 3.9 billion in 2015, compared  
to USD 3.1 billion in 2014. 
Property & casualty reinsurance 
contributed USD 3.0 billion, a modest 
decrease from the prior-year period, 
reflecting continued solid underwriting 
performance supported by benign 
natural catastrophe experience and 
favourable prior-year development.  
life & Health reinsurance reported net 
income of USD 939 million, reflecting  
a strong operating result, net realised 
gains and lower interest charges, 
compared to a loss of USD 462 million 
for 2014, which was mainly due to 
management actions addressing the 
pre-2004 US individual life business. 

corporate Solutions delivered net income 
of USD 340 million in 2015, compared  
to USD 319 million in 2014, reflecting 
continued profitable business  
performance across most lines of 
business and investment activities.
