Diversity and inclusion  
in our workforce

The commitment and expertise of  
our employees is the foundation of  
our continued success. We aim to  
be a leading employer that attracts  
talented people from a broad range  
of disciplines and backgrounds.  
by fostering a culture of inclusion, we 
can leverage and grow the diversity of 
our workforce. our diversity & inclusion 
(D&i) vision is to “see, feel and live 
diversity — diversity of gender, race, 
ethnicity, generation, sexual orientation 
(lGbT), physical (dis)abilities and 
experiences – at all levels, functions 
and regions of swiss re”.

such an inclusive corporate culture  
is essential for a diverse workforce. 
inclusion is about respecting the 
uniqueness of every individual and 
about providing an atmosphere in 
which everyone feels valued and 
empowered to perform at a consistently 
high level. being a diverse and inclusive 
company motivates our employees, 
helps to attract fresh talent and is  
good for bottom-line results.

There is strong evidence that diverse 
teams outperform non-diverse ones. As 
diverse teams avoid group think — and 
therefore institutional blindness — they 
can respond more quickly to changes in 
the external environment. Furthermore, 
a strong representation of local talent is 
crucial to developing new markets, 
which is one of our strategic priorities.

To foster diversity and inclusion across 
the whole organisation, we have set up 
a comprehensive strategic framework. 
backed by the Group CEo and the 
Group Executive Committee, our 
diversity & inclusion agenda is driven 
forward by a network of 35 D&i 
Champions, who are senior managers 
from a wide range of business areas,  
in addition to multiple geographically-
based D&i Councils and 25 inclusive 
employee networks at grassroots level 
worldwide.
