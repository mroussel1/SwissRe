Liquidity management
We actively manage liquidity 
risks to ensure that we can 
satisfy the financial obligations 
of the group.

As a re/insurance group, our core 
business generates liquidity  
primarily through premium income.  
Our exposure to liquidity risk stems 
mainly from two sources: the need to 
cover potential extreme loss events 
and regulatory constraints that limit 
the flow of funds within the Group. 

To manage these risks, we have a range 
of liquidity policies and measures in 
place. in particular, we aim to ensure that:
 ̤ sufficient liquidity is held to meet 

funding requirements under current 
conditions as well as adverse 
circumstances;

 ̤ funding is charged and credited at an 

appropriate market rate through our 
internal transfer pricing;

 ̤ diversified sources are used to meet 

our residual funding needs; and

 ̤ long-term liquidity needs are taken into 
account, both in our planning process 
and in our management of financial 
market risk.

Liquidity risk management
Our core liquidity policy is to retain 
sufficient liquidity in the form of unen- 
cumbered liquid assets and cash to meet 
potential funding requirements arising 
from a range of possible stress events.  
To allow for regulatory restrictions on 
intra-group funding, liquidity is managed 
within groups of entities known as 
liquidity pools. swiss Re is served by  
four main liquidity pools representing the 
parent companies of the group and each 
of the three Business Units. Each liquidity 
pool comprises the respective parent 
company and its unregulated subsidiaries 
whose funds are freely transferable to the 
parent company. The amount of liquidity 
held is largely determined by internal 
liquidity stress tests, which estimate the 
potential funding requirements stemming 
from extreme loss events. The funding 
requirements under stress include:
 ̤ cash and collateral outflows, as well as 

potential capital and funding support 
required by subsidiaries as a result of 
loss events;

 ̤ repayment or loss of all maturing 

unsecured debt and credit facilities;

 ̤ additional collateral requirements 
associated with a potential ratings 
downgrade;

 ̤ further contingent funding 

requirements related to asset 
downgrades; and

 ̤ other large committed payments, such 

as expenses, commissions and tax. 
 
The stress tests also assume that 
funding from assets is subject to 
conservative haircuts, that intra-group 
funding is not available if it is subject  
to regulatory approval, that no new 
unsecured funding is available, and 
that funding from new re/insurance 
business is reduced.
