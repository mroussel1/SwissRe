Note on risk factors

274  Swiss Re 2015 financial Report

General impact of adverse market conditions 
the operations of Swiss Re ltd (“Swiss Re”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as well 
as its investment returns are subject to market volatility and macro-economic factors, 
which are outside of the Group’s control and are often inter-related. 

Despite signs of moderate increase in global growth forecasts and positive macro-
economic trends in the United States, growth forecasts among the principal global 
economies remain uneven and uncertain, and that uncertainty has been compounded 
by significant volatility in equity, currency and commodities markets. Slower growth 
rates in China, together with the actions taken on its currency, and drastic reductions  
in the price of oil, together with volatility in foreign currency and investment markets 
caused by interest rate action in the United States; continued concerns over the 
implications of austerity-driven economic policies in europe and the ability of the 
european Union to address significant ongoing structural challenges; concerns over  
a possible exit of the United Kingdom from the european Union; deceleration in GDP 
growth and other negative trends in emerging markets; and geopolitical instability, 
reflecting the political and military situations in the middle east and north africa, the 
rise of the islamic State, concerns over further terrorist attacks across the globe and 
the political, economic and social crises caused by massive waves of migration into 
and through europe, have contributed to downward pressure on the capital markets 
and in turn on market capitalization of many listed companies, call into question the 
likelihood of continued recovery of the global economies and are beginning to raise  
the spectre of another global recession. 

With fewer options available to policymakers and concerns generally over the absence 
of realistic confidence-building measures, and with heightened risk that volatility  
or depressed conditions in one sector, one market, one country or one region could  
have far broader implications, volatility can be expected to continue. further adverse 
developments or the continuation of adverse trends that in turn have a negative  
impact on financial markets and economic conditions could limit our ability to access  
the capital markets and bank funding markets, could adversely affect the ability  
of counterparties to meet their obligations to us and could adversely affect the 
confidence of the ultimate buyers of insurance. any such developments and trends 
could also have an adverse effect on the Group’s investment results, which in the 
current low interest rate environment and soft insurance cycle could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s overall results, make it difficult to determine the value  
of certain assets in the Group’s portfolio and/or make it difficult to acquire suitable 
investments to meet the Group’s risk and return criteria.

Regulatory changes
Swiss Re and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject 
to group supervision. Swiss Re’s subsidiaries are subject to applicable regulation in 
each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business, particularly Switzerland,  
the United States, the United Kingdom, luxembourg and Germany. the regulatory 
regimes to which members of the Group are subject have changed significantly in 
recent years and are expected to continue to evolve as a result of global efforts 
following the credit crisis. 

although early regulatory efforts following the credit crisis were focused primarily  
on banking institutions, there has been a noticeable trend in recent years to extend  
the scope of reforms and oversight beyond such institutions to cover insurance and 
reinsurance operations. legislative initiatives directly impacting the Group’s industry 
include the establishment of a pan-european regulator for insurance companies,
