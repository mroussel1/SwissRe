Swiss Re’s dividend policy
Swiss re’s dividend policy is a central 
element of Swiss re’s capital manage-
ment priorities. The Group aims to ensure 
a superior capitalisation at all times and 
maximise financial flexibility, growing the 
regular dividend with long-term earnings 
and at a minimum maintaining it. 
Swiss re will then deploy capital for 
business growth where it meets its 
strategy and profitability requirements 
and repatriate further excess capital to 
shareholders, with the preferred form of 
future capital repatriation being share 
buy-back progammes.
