Company exclusions
The policies of our sustainability risk 
Framework specify certain criteria that 
may lead to the exclusion of a company 
from both our re/insurance transactions 
and our investments, to the extent  
that such an exclusion is permissible  
(eg by virtue of mandatory law or  
internal policies) and possible (eg if 
existing documentation relating to  
such re/insurance transactions and 
investments provide for it). These criteria 
include: involvement in prohibited war 
material; verifiable complicity in systemic, 
repeated and severe human rights 
violations; causing repeated, severe and 
unmitigated damage to the environment; 
proliferation of nuclear weapons; and 
unethical/cruel animal testing practices. 

Country exclusions
swiss re also excludes certain countries 
from its business, beyond compliance 
with international trade controls (iTCs). 
The criterion for these country exclusions 
is a particularly poor human rights record. 
our goal is not to directly underwrite risks 
or make investments in entities that are 
based in these countries. At the end of 
2015, the countries excluded from our 
business for human rights reasons were 
North Korea, somalia, sudan (North only) 
and syria. The underlying methodology 
has recently been revised and is being 
implemented in 2016.
