as of 31 December 2015, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries, branches 
and associates and interests in joint ventures, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised amount to approximately 
UsD 4.4 billion. in the remote scenario in which these temporary differences were to reverse simultaneously, the resulting tax 
liabilities would be very limited due to participation exemption rules.
