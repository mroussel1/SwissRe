Swiss Re Group’s capital adequacy
Regulatory capital requirements
swiss Re is supervised at group level and 
for its regulated legal entities domiciled  
in switzerland by FiNmA. FiNmA 
supervision comprises minimum solvency 
requirements, along with a wide range of 
qualitative assessments and governance 
standards.

swiss Re provides regulatory solvency 
reporting to FiNmA under the rules of the 
insurance supervision Ordinance. This 
ssT report is based on an economic view. 
We calculate available capital based on 
our Economic Value management (EVm) 
framework and required capital under the 
ssT using our internal risk model (see 
pages 55–56 for further information on 
EVm). The minimum requirement for the 
ssT is a ratio of 100%. swiss Re’s ssT 
ratio materially exceeds the minimum 
requirement. 

swiss Re’s capital management aims to 
ensure our ability to continue operations 
following an extremely adverse year of 
losses from insurance and/or financial 
market events.

Rating agency capital requirements

to the obligations of swiss Re and its 
rated subsidiaries.

The agencies evaluate swiss Re based  
on a set of criteria that include an 
assessment of our capital adequacy.

Each rating agency uses a different 
methodology for this assessment; A.m. 
Best and s&p base their evaluation on 
proprietary capital models.
