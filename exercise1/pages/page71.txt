Description

Developments in 2015

in 2015, swiss Re’s credit risk —  
which includes default and migration 
(deterioration in credit rating) risk — 
increased by 29% to Usd 3.4 billion  
(see table on page 65) and the credit 
default stress test increased by 22%  
(see table above). 

The changes reflect the inclusion of  
the guardian Financial services portfolio  
(see page 51) and growth in the 
underwriting portfolio.  

Credit risk is the risk of incurring  
a financial loss due to diminished 
creditworthiness or default of swiss Re’s 
counterparties or of third parties (credit 
spread risk falls under financial market 
risk). Credit risk arises primarily from  
our investment activities as well as from 
liabilities underwritten by our Business 
Units, such as credit, surety and from 
retrocession. We distinguish between 
three types of credit exposure: the risk of 
issuer default from instruments in which 
swiss Re invests or trades; counterparty 
exposure in a direct contractual 
relationship; and risk assumed by  
swiss Re through reinsurance contracts. 

 

Management

Credit risk is managed and monitored by 
our Credit Risk management unit within 
the central Financial Risk management 
team.

corporate counterparty credit quality  
and exposures, and compiling watch  
lists of cases that merit close attention.

management strategies for individual 
counterparties, industry sectors,  
and geographic regions.

An aggregate credit stress limit is set  
by the group Executive Committee.  
in addition, we assign aggregate credit 
limits by Business Unit, corporate 
counterparty and country. These limits 
are based on multiple factors, including 
the prevailing economic environment, the 
nature of the underlying credit exposures 
and a detailed internal assessment of the 
counterparty’s financial strength, industry 
position and other qualitative factors. 
Financial Risk management is also 

Financial Risk management monitors and 
reports credit exposure and limits for the 
group and its Business Units on a weekly 
basis. The reporting process is supported 
by a group-wide credit exposure 
information system that contains all 
relevant data, including corporate 
counterparty details, ratings, credit risk 
exposures, credit limits, and watch lists. 
All credit practitioners in the group and 
Business Units have access to this 
system, thus providing the necessary 

To take account of country risks other 
than from credit default, swiss Re’s 
political and sustainability Risk 
management unit prepares specific 
country ratings in addition to the 
sovereign ratings used by the group  
and the Business Units. These ratings  
are considered in the decision-making 
process, and cover political, economic 
and security-related country risks.
