Provisions
Provisions contain provision for currency fluctuation and provision for taxation.

the provision for currency fluctuation comprises the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the yearly 
revaluation of the opening balance sheet and the translation adjustment of the income statement from average to closing exchange 
rates at year-end. these net impacts are recognised in the income statement over a period of up to three years. Where the provision 
for currency fluctuation is insufficient to absorb net foreign exchange losses for the financial year, the provision for currency 
fluctuation is reduced to zero and the excess foreign exchange loss is recognised in the income statement.

the provision for taxation represents an estimate of taxes payable in respect of the reporting year.
