Collateral pledged or received between two counterparties with a master netting arrangement in place, but not subject to balance 
sheet netting is disclosed at fair value. The fair values represent the gross carrying value amounts at the reporting date for each 
financial instrument received or pledged by the Group. Management believes that master netting agreements provide for legally 
enforceable set-off in the event of default, which substantially reduces credit exposure. Upon occurrence of an event of default 
the non-defaulting party may set off the obligation against collateral received regardless if offset on the balance sheet prior to  
the defaulting event. The net amounts of the financial assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet were recognised in  
“Other invested assets”, and “Accrued expenses and other liabilities”, respectively.
