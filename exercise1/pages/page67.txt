Swiss Re’s risk landscape
The risk categories shown 
in the table on the right are 
discussed on the following 
pages. Across these 
categories we identify and 
evaluate emerging threats  
and opportunities through a 
systematic framework that 
includes the assessment of 
potential surprise factors  
that could affect known loss 
potentials. Liquidity risk 
management is discussed 
above, on page 57.

1  Credit comprises credit default and credit migration risk from both asset management and underwriting. Credit spread risk falls under financial market risk.

Our internal risk model takes account of the accumulation and diversification between individual risks. The effect of 
diversification at the category level is demonstrated in the table above, which represents the difference between the group  
99% tail VaR and the sum of standalone tail VaR amounts in the individual risk categories. The extent of diversification is largely 
determined by the selected level of aggregation — the higher the aggregation level, the lower the diversification effect.
