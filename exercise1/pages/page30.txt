28  Swiss Re 2015 Financial report

Strategy
During 2015 Swiss re continued to 
maintain a balanced asset allocation 
with a steady allocation to government 
bonds and cash. We selectively added 
corporate bonds and loans across 
multiple currencies to further diversify 
our credit portfolio. We also 
significantly expanded our real estate 
allocation by 0.7% after a reduction  
in equity and hedge fund exposures 
during 2014.

Financial markets overview
During the first half of 2015, equity prices 
held up well while government bond 
yields moved higher and credit spreads 
widened driven by heavy supply. The risk 
of Greece leaving the eurozone resulted 
in significant market nervousness around 
mid-year. additionally, the surprise 
change in the chinese exchange rate 
regime in august, amid already growing 
concern about economic slowdown, 
significantly influenced market sentiment 
and pushed equity market volatility to its 
highest level since the eurozone crisis 
began in 2011. Sentiment subsequently 
recovered in the final quarter of the year.

The 2015 market movements occurred 
against a backdrop of improving 
economic growth across developed 
economies, albeit with weaker external 
demand from the emerging economies. 
labour markets in the US and UK have 
become increasingly tight as 
unemployment rates approach the 
natural rate, as evidenced by rising wages 
in the closing stages of the year. However, 
pass-through to headline inflation has 
been exceptionally low as commodity 
price weakness has continued to weigh 
on prices. Heading into 2016 these base 
effects may reverse and inflation could 
steadily rise again. Markets ended  
2015 with strong expectations that the 
ultra-accommodative monetary policy  
in the US was coming to an end.
