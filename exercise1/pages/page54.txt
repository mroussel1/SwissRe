Capital management
We have already achieved  
Usd 6 billion of deleveraging 
ahead of our 2016 target of 
Usd 4 billion.

During 2015, Swiss Re continued 
deleveraging, maintained its strong 
capitalisation and further directed 
excess capital from its Business Units 
to the Group’s holding company, 
Swiss Re Ltd.

Optimised Group capital structure
swiss Re’s level of capitalisation and its 
capital structure are driven by regulatory 
and rating capital requirements,  
and management’s view of risks and 
opportunities arising from our 
underwriting and investing activities. As 
announced at the June 2013 investors’ 
day, we set a target capital structure 
objective that aims to operate efficiently 
within these constraints by maximising 
financial flexibility. The structure focuses 
on the reduction of senior leverage, 
including letters of credit (lOCs), the 
issuance of contingent capital to replace 
traditional subordinated debt and 
extending the group’s funding platform.

Key milestones achieved in 2015 
Two further important milestones 
towards full implementation of the target 
capital structure were achieved in 2015:

in November 2015, swiss Re ltd 
established a Usd 700 million 
subordinated debt facility at an attractive 
interest rate of 5.75%. The transaction 
establishes a funding platform at the 
holding company and brings the group 
closer to its target capital structure 
objective in contingent capital form, 
further enhancing the group’s financial 
flexibility. Unlike previous contingent 
capital transactions, this platform allows 
swiss Re to decide when to reinforce its 
capital position at locked-in rates.

Overall group deleveraging has totalled 
Usd 6 billion since year-end 2012,  
and achieved the deleveraging target of  
Usd 4 billion ahead of 2016. Net senior 
deleveraging in 2015 amounted to  
Usd 1.2 billion, driven by Usd 0.7 billion 
senior debt maturities and redemptions 
and a net Usd 0.7 billion reduction  
in lOCs and related instruments, offset by 
new senior issuances and bank funding 
of Usd 0.2 billion.
