the Group reported a tax charge of UsD 651 million on a pre-tax income of UsD 5 319 million for 2015, compared to a charge  
of UsD 658 million on a pre-tax income of UsD 4 227 million for 2014. this translates into an effective tax rate in the current  
and prior-year reporting periods of 12.2% and 15.6%, respectively. the lower tax rate in 2015 was largely driven by a tax benefit 
arising from a local statutory adjustment for the restructuring of subsidiaries, higher tax benefits from foreign currency translation 
differences between statutory and GaaP accounts, and the release of valuation allowances partially offset by tax on profits 
earned in higher tax jurisdictions.
