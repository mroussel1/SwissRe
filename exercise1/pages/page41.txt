 

Investment result
The return on investments for 2015  
was 3.4% compared to 3.2% in 2014, 
reflecting a lower invested asset  
base alongside a slight increase in  
the investment result of USD 2 million.  
The change in the investment result  
was driven by an improved result from 
derivatives and additional gains from 
sales which were offset by lower net 
investment income due to net asset 
outflows from the unwinding of a 
funding structure in 2014. 

net investment income of  
USD 1.1 billion in 2015 was lower  
than USD 1.2 billion in 2014 mainly  
due to net asset outflows related to  
the unwinding of a funding structure.  
The fixed income running yield was 
3.5% in the reporting period.

net realised gains were USD 85 million 
in 2015 compared to net losses of  
USD 72 million in 2014, as the prior  
year included losses from an interest  
rate hedge. 

insurance-related investment results  
are not included in the figures above.

Shareholdersʼ equity
common shareholders’ equity was 
USD 5.8 billion at the end of 2015, 
slightly below the shareholders’  
equity at the end of 2014. net income 
of USD 939 million was offset by 
unrealised losses, the impact of  
foreign exchange rate movements  
and a dividend payment. The return  
on equity for 2015 was 15.7%.  
after adjusting for realised gains and 
one-off model adjustments, and using 
the equity capital of USD 5.5 billion 
announced as the basis for our 2015 
target at the June 2013 investors’ Day, 
return on equity was 11.8%, meeting 
the target of 10%–12%.

Outlook
in mature markets, the low interest rate 
environment will continue to have an 
unfavourable impact on long-term life 
business. in addition, cession rates in the 
US are expected to decrease as primary 
insurers retain more risk. However,  
high growth markets will see stronger 
increases in life and health businesses 
and primary insurers’ cession rates  
are expected to be stable. as a result,  
we expect life and health reinsurance 
business to be relatively flat in mature 
markets and to increase in high growth 
markets.

Market share of 
Top 6 reinsurers 

(revenues)

70%

as with Property & casualty, the data 
show that life & Health reinsurance 
retains a significant portion of the 
industry’s profits. in this comparison 
with five peers, we have used operating 
income to measure profits to get around 
differences caused by accounting 
treatment. 

While the data for 2014 show the 
impact of our management actions  
with respect to the pre-2004 US  
individual life business and the 
unwinding of an asset funding structure, 
the results show us quickly back on 
track in 2015. This year we met the 
return on equity target we set for 
ourselves in 2013 of 10%–12%,  
ending at 11.8% for 2015, using  
the terms set for that target.
