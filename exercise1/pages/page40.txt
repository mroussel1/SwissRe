life & Health reinsurance

Performance 
life & Health reinsurance met its return 
on equity target of 10%–12% for 2015 
which was announced at the investors’ 
Day in June 2013. The management 
actions taken in relation to the pre-
2004 US individual life business, the 
unwinding of an asset funding structure 
for a longevity transaction, as well  
as capital optimisation and asset 
rebalancing have all contributed to help  
life & Health meet the target and set the 
foundation for future profitable growth. 
Managing the in-force business  
will continue to be a key priority for  
Swiss re while growing new business 
in 2016 and beyond. 

Net income
net income for 2015 was 
USD 939 million, compared to a net loss 
of USD 462 million in 2014. The strong 
performance in 2015 reflects significant 
improvement in operating results, net 
realised gains and lower interest charges. 

The loss in 2014 was mainly due to the 
management actions in respect of the 
pre-2004 US individual life business,  
as well as to net realised losses driven  
by the unwinding of the asset funding 
structure. 

Net premiums earned and fee income
net premiums earned and fee income 
decreased by 2.7% to USD 11.0 billion  
in 2015, compared to USD 11.3 billion  
in 2014. at constant exchange rates, 
premiums earned and fee income were 
6.1% higher in 2015. The 2015 figure 
benefited from several longevity deals  
in the UK, and large transactions in 
australia, europe and South africa 
contributed towards new business 
growth. in addition, rate increases in the 
yearly renewable term business in the 
americas contributed to the 2015 result.

Operating margin ratio
The operating margin for 2015 was 
9.9% compared to 2.6% for 2014.  
The higher margin stems from the 
significant improvement in life and 
health operating income along

with lower premiums earned and  
fee income. The prior-year margin  
was substantially lower due to the 
management actions in relation to 
pre-2004 US individual life business.

Administrative expense ratio
The administrative expense ratio was 
7.3% for 2015 compared to 6.9% in 
2014 due to an increase in variable 
compensation.

Operating income
The life segment reported operating 
income of USD 641 million compared  
to a loss of USD 66 million in 2014.  
The current year results benefited from 
the management actions taken in the 
prior year in relation to the pre-2004  
US individual life business, and a less 
unfavourable pre-2004 US post-level 
term business result in the current 
period. These were partly offset by  
lower investment income following  

the unwinding of an asset funding 
structure supporting a longevity 
transaction. The loss in 2014 was  
mainly due to management actions  
in respect of the pre-2004 US individual 
life business.

Operating income for the health 
segment increased to USD 593 million 
compared to USD 397 million in 2014. 
The 2015 results benefited from interest 
rate updates in the valuation of disabled 
life reserves, and were adversely 
impacted by reserve strengthening for 
UK critical illness business. The 2014 
results were impacted by an increase in 
disabled life reserves in the US and UK.

The 2014 operating income of 
life & Health does not include the  
pre-tax charge on the unwinding of  
the asset funding structure. This charge  
was included under non-participating 
realised gains/losses.
