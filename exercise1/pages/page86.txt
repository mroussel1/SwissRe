Independence
Swiss re’s Group Bylaws stipulate that  
at least three-quarters of the members  
of the Board of Directors must be 
independent. Independence is defined  
in line with best practice corporate 
governance standards. to be considered 
independent a Group Board member may 
not be, and may not have been in the past 
three years, employed as a member of 
the Group eC, or by any Subsidiary of  
the Swiss re Group or may not have a 
material relationship with any part of the 
Swiss re Group (either directly or as  
a partner, director or shareholder of  
an organisation that has a material 
relationship with the Swiss re Group) 
other than serving as an independent 
board member in any Subsidiary.  
In addition, the Group Board agrees  
on other criteria that disqualify a Group 
Board member from being considered 
independent, taking into consideration 
provisions of applicable law, regulations 
and best practice. all the members  
of the Board of Directors meet our 
independence criteria with the exception 
of our Chairman. as a full-time Chairman 
he is not considered independent. 

Conflicts of interest 
the members of the Board of Directors 
are also subject to procedures to  
avoid any action, position or interest that 
conflicts with an interest of Swiss re Ltd 
or the Swiss re Group or gives the 
appearance of a conflict.
