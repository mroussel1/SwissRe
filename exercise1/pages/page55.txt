External dividends to shareholders 
Based on the group’s capital strength,  
the Board of directors proposes an 8.2% 
increase in the 2015 regular dividend  
to CHF 4.60 per share, up from CHF 4.25 
in 2014. in addition, the Board of 
directors proposes a public share buy- 
back programme of up to CHF 1.0 billion 
purchase value, exercisable until the Agm 
in 2017. The programme will only be 
launched if excess capital is available,  
no major loss event has occurred, other 
business opportunities do not meet 
swiss Re’s strategic and financial 
objectives and the necessary regulatory 
approvals have been obtained.

These capital measures are expected to 
bring the total amount of capital returned 
to shareholders to Usd 12.1 billion since 
the implementation of the new group 
structure in 2012, even excluding the 
upcoming proposed share buy-back.

 
The group capital structure is 
comfortably within our senior leverage 
(15%–25%) and subordinated leverage 
(15%–20%) target ranges, providing 
further financial flexibility.

in addition we managed our subordinated 
debt maturity profile by replacing part of 
the EUR 1 billion subordinated perpetual 
loan notes issued by swiss Reinsurance 
Company ltd in 2006 with new 
EUR 750 million perpetual subordinated 
callable loan notes with a first call date in 
2025 at  a coupon of 2.6%.

Legal entity capital management  
Our regulated subsidiaries are subject  
to local regulatory requirements,  
which for our EU subsidiaries include  
solvency ii. At the subsidiary level we  
set the target capital at a level tailored  
to each entity’s business and the  
market environment in which it operates.  
Our underwriting and investment 
decisions are steered so as to make 
capital and liquidity fungible to the group 
wherever possible, while complying with 
local regulations and client needs.

Cash dividends paid to swiss Re ltd 
totalled Usd 3.7 billion in 2015.
