other actions that may negatively impact the Group’s ratings. in addition, changes  
to the process or methodology of issuing ratings, or the occurrence of events or 
developments affecting the Group, could make it more difficult for the Group to 
achieve improved ratings which it would otherwise have expected. 

as claims paying and financial strength ratings are key factors in establishing the 
competitive position of reinsurers, a decline in ratings alone could make reinsurance 
provided by the Group less attractive to clients relative to reinsurance from competitors 
with similar or stronger ratings. a decline in ratings could also cause the loss of clients 
who are required by either policy or regulation to purchase reinsurance only from 
reinsurers with certain ratings. Certain larger reinsurance contracts contain terms  
that would allow the ceding companies to cancel the contract if the Group’s ratings  
or those of its subsidiaries are downgraded beyond a certain threshold. moreover,  
a decline in ratings could impact the availability and terms of unsecured financing  
and obligate the Group to provide collateral or other guarantees in the course of its 
reinsurance business or trigger early termination of funding arrangements potentially 
resulting in a need for additional liquidity. as a ratings decline could also have a 
material adverse impact on the Group’s costs of borrowing or ability to access the 
capital markets, the adverse implications of a downgrade could be more severe.

Legal and regulatory risks
in the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations  
and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, the outcomes of which 
determine rights and obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual 
agreements. from time to time, the Group may institute, or be named as a defendant 
in, legal proceedings, and the Group may be a claimant or respondent in arbitration 
proceedings. these proceedings could involve coverage or other disputes with ceding 
companies, disputes with parties to which the Group transfers risk under reinsurance 
arrangements, disputes with other counterparties or other matters. the Group cannot 
predict the outcome of any of the foregoing, which could be material for the Group. 

the Group is also involved, from time to time, in investigations and regulatory 
proceedings, certain of which could result in adverse judgements, settlements, fines 
and other outcomes. the number of these investigations and proceedings involving 
the financial services industry has increased in recent years, and the potential scope  
of these investigations and proceedings has also increased, not only in respect of 
matters covered by the Group’s direct regulators, but also in respect of compliance 
with broader business conduct rules, including those in respect of market abuse, 
bribery, money laundering, trade sanctions and data protection and privacy. 
the Group also is subject to audits and challenges from time to time by tax authorities, 
which could result in increases in tax costs, changes to internal structures and interest 
and penalties. the Group could be subject to risks arising from alleged, or actual, 
violations of any of the foregoing, and could also be subject to risks arising from 
potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with internal policies  
and procedures and malfeasance, such as undertaking or facilitating cyber attacks  
on internal systems. Substantial legal liability could materially adversely affect the 
Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations or could cause significant 
reputational harm, which could seriously affect its business.

Insurance, operational and other risks
as part of the Group’s ordinary course operations, the Group is subject to a variety of 
risks, including risks that reserves may not adequately cover future claims and benefits, 
risks that catastrophic events (including hurricanes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, 
acts of terrorism, man-made disasters such as industrial accidents, explosions, and 
fires, and pandemics) may expose the Group to unexpected large losses (and related 
uncertainties in estimating future claims in respect of such events); changes in the 
insurance industry that affect ceding companies, particularly those that further 
increase their sensitivity to counterparty risk; competitive conditions (including as a 
result of consolidation and the availability of significant levels of alternative capacity); 
cyclicality of the industry; risks related to emerging claims and coverage issues 
(including, for example, trends to establish stricter building standards, which can lead 
to higher industry losses for earthquake cover based on higher replacement values);
