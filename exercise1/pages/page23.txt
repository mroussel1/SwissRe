estimated global premium growth  
in 2015

The operating margin of the life reinsu-
rance industry was 8% of net premiums 
earned in 2015, compared to 7% in 
2014, based on improvements in the 
underwriting results. The contribution 
from investments further declined,  
due to the ongoing low interest rate 
environment. 

Outlook
Traditional life reinsurance is expected 
to continue to stagnate in the next few 
years, driven by ongoing contraction  
of this segment in the US and UK, 
while other mature markets will record 
moderate growth in line with the 
growth of protection business on the 
primary side. in emerging markets,  
life reinsurance is expected to increase 
by about 6%‒7%. By contrast, the 
pressure on a number of primary life 
insurers will likely generate steady 
demand for capital solutions and other 
forms of non-traditional reinsurance.

Market overview
The size of the global life reinsurance 
business was around USD 65 billion  
in 2015. Most (70%) of this stems from 
the US, canada and the UK. ceding 
companies from emerging countries 
accounted for only 6% of global 
demand. life reinsurers are 
increasingly diversifying away  
from traditional mortality business.

Market performance
The life reinsurance industry registered  
a currency-driven decline of 3%.  
currency- and inflation-adjusted  
premium income rose by 3% in 2015.  
The accident & Health business 
supported some premium growth, as  
did large annuity and longevity contracts. 
Meanwhile, other business lines had 
weak organic growth and some treaties 
were cancelled. Health and annuity 
transactions are expected to continue  
to drive growth in the coming years and 
also help reinsurers in the UK and north 
america diversify away from traditional 
mortality business. 

Global premiums in traditional life 
reinsurance, consisting of mortality and 
morbidity, are estimated to have grown 
by 2% in real terms in 2015. in mature 
markets, a 1% increase was driven by 
positive developments in the UK and  
the large continental european markets, 
while premiums in the US continued to 
contract as a result of lower cession rates 
and still-weak protection sales. in the 
emerging markets, premiums grew by 
8%. Growth in asia (particularly china) 
and latin america was strong, mirroring 
the primary market.
