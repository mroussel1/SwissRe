50  Swiss Re 2015 Financial Report

In 2015 we continued to be very 
strongly capitalised and to apply  
our risk appetite framework, which 
establishes the overall approach 
through which we practise controlled 
risk-taking throughout our Group.

Capitalisation
Throughout 2015 we held capital well  
in excess of applicable external capital 
adequacy requirements. Under the swiss 
solvency Test (ssT), the group’s 
regulatory capitalisation was 223%,  
as submitted to the swiss Financial 
market supervisory Authority (FiNmA)  
in April 2015. The group ssT economic 
capitalisation at the end of 2015 is 
estimated at above 200%. Rating 
agencies A.m. Best, moody’s and 
standard & poor’s (s&p) rated swiss Re’s 
financial strength ‘superior,’ ‘excellent’ 
and ‘very strong’, respectively  
(see page 54).

Our overall goal for capital management 
is to maintain a capital structure that 
operates efficiently within the above 
constraints and maximises our  
financial flexibility. Our underwriting  
and investment decisions are steered  
to make capital and liquidity fungible  
to the group wherever possible, while 
complying with local regulations and 
client needs. Cash dividends paid  
to the group’s parent holding company,  
swiss Re ltd, totalled Usd 3.7 billion  
in 2015.
