Economic Value management

Best estimates
swiss Re values assets and liabilities 
based on best estimates of underlying 
cash flows — premiums, claims, 
expenses, taxes, capital costs, etc — 
taking into consideration all the 
information available at inception of a 
contract. As with other valuation methods 
that depend on projections of future  
cash flows, EVm involves a significant  
degree of judgement in establishing what 
assumptions should be used. swiss Re 
actively and carefully reviews its 
assumptions, seeking both to achieve 
consistency across business activities 
and to reflect all available information.

Performance measurement after 
capital costs
EVm explicitly recognises opportunity 
costs for shareholder capital. Cost-of- 
capital charges include the base cost  
of capital and frictional capital costs.  
The base cost of capital is reflected 
through a charge for risk-free returns  
on available capital and market risk 
premiums. market risk premiums 
compensate for systematic, non-
diversifiable risk exposure, mainly 
assumed through investing activities. 
Frictional capital costs compensate for 
agency costs, costs of potential financial 
distress and regulatory (illiquidity) costs; 
they are reflected through a 4% charge 
on available capital and an average 2% 
charge on leverage.

Economic net worth in 2015
Economic net worth (ENW) is defined  
as the difference between the market 
value of assets and the market-
consistent value of liabilities. ENW is the 
EVm measure of shareholders’ equity 
and the starting point in determining 
available capital for ssT calculations.

in 2015, ENW decreased by 
Usd 1.0 billion to Usd 37.4 billion  
at the end of december 2015. 2015  
EVm income of Usd 3.7 billion was  
more than offset by the swiss Re group’s 
dividend payments and foreign 
exchange rate movements.
