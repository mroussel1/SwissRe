Strategy and priorities 
Our reinsurance Business Unit strategy 
focuses on differentiation and profitable 
growth through a dedicated emphasis 
on profitable risk pools, enabled  
by a strong operating platform and  
talent base.

Systematically allocate capital  
to risk pools/revenue streams 
By applying metrics based on cash  
flow, US GaaP and our integrated  
economic Value Management (eVM)  
framework we seek to steer both 
Property & casualty (P&c) and 
life & Health (l&H) reinsurance 
businesses to the most profitable risk 
pools. as a result we’ve been shifting the 
weighting of our lines of business in line 
with our underwriting framework and 
growth strategy. in P&c, we prioritised 
high growth markets and have been 
reducing property business since 2013 
where prices have become increasingly 
challenging. in l&H we continued to 
grow the contribution from high growth 
markets and from health, in particular.

We allocate capital to the most  
attractive lines of business and steer  
it toward the business that is most 
relevant for our clients. We have been 
emphasising transactions, which are 
tailored, complex solution structures  
that efficiently fit client needs and bring 
unique added value. Demand for such 
structures is being driven especially  
by more stringent solvency and capital 
standards, often in l&H.
