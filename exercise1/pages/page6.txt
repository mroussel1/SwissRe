MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Keeping the long term in view
The strategic priorities that 
will shape our future

“ Three things set us apart:  
capital strength, client  
relationships and knowledge.”

4  Swiss Re 2015 Financial Report

Dear shareholders,
Another very successful year for your 
company has just ended and this report 
will explain it in great detail. For this 
success to happen we needed, of course, 
benign circumstances, but we also 
needed the full effort of dedicated 
employees, our loyal clients and,  
last but not least, the support of  
our shareholders. To the many that 
contributed throughout the year,  
my sincere thanks. 

The conundrum: lower prices, but 
ever-higher margins and less demand
In 2015 we again observed high 
margins, and as a consequence high 
returns. The most significant were in 
Property & Casualty Reinsurance, but  
also in our life and health businesses, 
which have recovered from difficult 
results the year before.

At the same time many market 
participants speak about a significant 
erosion of pricing levels across all 
businesses. They complain about this 
and about a further reduction in 
investment returns. The relationship 
between demand and available capacity 
seems out of balance — and while we  
all complain, margins have remained  
strong for quite a few years now.
