Our differentiation strategy is successful 
and well-acknowledged by our clients. 
We continue to execute this strategy 
while focusing on the bottom line in a 
softening market environment. We will 
reduce capacity for flow business and 
focus on large and tailored transactions.

 

Investment result
The return on investments for 2015  
was 3.5% compared to 3.7% in 2014, 
reflecting a decrease in the investment 
result of USD 212 million. The decrease 
was driven by reduced net realised gains 
from the sale of equity securities in the 
current period.

net investment income increased by 
USD 37 million to USD 1 036 million in 
2015, mainly due to additional income 
from duration lengthening in the second 
half of 2014 as well as in 2015.

net realised gains were USD 497 million 
in 2015 compared to USD 730 million  
in 2014, as the prior period included 
additional gains from the sale of equity 
securities and alternative investments, 
which were partially offset by additional 
gains from the sale of government bonds 
in the current period.

insurance-related investment results  
are not included in the figures above.

Shareholders’ equity 
The return on equity for 2015 was 
22.2% compared to 26.7% in 2014, 
mainly due to lower earnings in 2015. 
common shareholders’ equity for the 
business segment was USD 13.0 billion 
at the end of 2015 compared to  
USD 13.9 billion at the end of 2014. 
The decrease was driven by dividend 
payments to the Group, unrealised 
losses and lower 2015 net income. 

Outlook
Price erosion due to abundant capital  
and low loss occurrence continues for 
property, except for some loss-affected 
programmes. For special lines, rates  
are also under pressure, with significant 
differences by markets and lines of 
business. casualty markets also saw rate 
decreases but overall remain more stable, 
with significant differences by segment.

Successful differentiation will remain  
the key for new business wins, large  
and tailored transactions and differential 
pricing.

consistently outperforming the market in profitability

Property & casualty reinsurance has 
consistently outperformed the market. 
combining the results from Swiss re 
and six of our peers, the results show 
that we have extracted a higher share  
of the industry’s profits than our market 
share would suggest — meaning 
principally that solid underwriting has 
been a key driver of shareholder value. 

This also applies, coincidentally, in 
2011, when our industry experienced 
extraordinarily high natural catastrophe 
losses but the impact on Swiss re was 
relatively smaller compared to peers.
