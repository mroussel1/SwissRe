The primary liquidity stress test is based 
on a one-year time horizon, a loss event 
corresponding to 99% Tail Value at Risk 
(see pages 64–65), and a three-notch 
ratings downgrade.

swiss Re’s liquidity stress tests are 
reviewed regularly and their main 
assumptions are approved by the group 
Executive Committee. swiss Re provides 
FiNmA with a yearly report on its liquidity 
position, in accordance with FiNmA’s 
circular 13/5,“liquidity — insurers.”

Liquidity position of the 
Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd 
(SRZ) liquidity pool
The sRZ liquidity pool is the primary 
liquidity pool of the group. The estimated 
total liquidity sources in the sRZ liquidity 
pool available within one year, after 
haircuts and net of short-term loans  
from swiss Re ltd, amounted to 
Usd 19.6 billion as  

of 31 december 2015, compared 
with Usd 20.4 billion as of 
31 december 2014. The 2015 total 
includes Usd 13.7 billion of liquid assets 
and cash, referred to as “spot liquidity”, 
compared with Usd 15.0 billion in 2014. 
Based on the internal liquidity stress tests 
described above, we estimate that the 
sRZ liquidity pool holds surplus liquidity 
after dividends to swiss Re ltd.

in 2015, the amount of surplus liquidity 
improved slightly. The reduction of 
liquidity due to the payment of the 
dividend for 2014 to swiss Re ltd and 
repayments of external debt was more 
than offset by positive operating cash 
flows, dividends from subsidiaries as well 
as a reduction in contingent funding 
requirements stemming from extreme 
stress loss events.
