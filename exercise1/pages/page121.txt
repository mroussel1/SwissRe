Awareness raising and advocacy
We regularly share our insights into the 
risks created by climate change through 
our publications and stakeholder 
events, and support efforts to form a 
reliable international policy framework, 
eg by taking part in the United Nations’ 
Cop conferences.

in 2015, we also partnered with 
standard & poor’s in a special project  
to quantify the impact of natural 
catastrophes and climate change on 
sovereign ratings. based on a sample  
of 38 countries, our simulations indicate 
that natural disasters (earthquakes, 
tropical storms, floods and winter 
storms) of a severity that is likely to 
occur once every 250 years can indeed 
weaken the affected sovereign’s rating. 
Moreover, climate change can be 
expected to increase this impact by 
20% on average. The expected effect  
is strongest in emerging countries and 
especially in the event of earthquakes 
and tropical storms: the most severe  
of these disasters could lead to a 
downgrade of around 1.5 notches. 
However, the study also found that  
this potential effect can be significantly 
reduced by catastrophe insurance.

Tackling our carbon footprint
The fourth pillar of our climate strategy 
focuses on the emissions from our own 
operations. Through our pioneering 
Greenhouse Neutral programme we 
halved our emissions per employee 
between 2003 and 2013 and set  
off all remaining emissions. our new 
commitment, valid until 2020, is to keep 
our per capita emissions stable at the 
2013 level even as we continue to 
pursue an ambitious strategy in high 
growth markets. As part of our new 
commitment, we have also extended  
the scope of our emissions accounting  
and reporting to include five additional 
emission sources.

After an increase in 2014, total Co2 
emissions per employee (FTE, full-time 
equivalent) dropped by 4% during 2015, 
mainly driven by a further reduction in 
the energy intensity of our offices and 
decreases in the emissions from 
commuting and business travel.  
The latter was due to the fact that our 
employees made fewer business trips  
in carbon-intense flight classes, even 
though the total distances they travelled 
increased slightly on average. (Detailed 
data for all reported emission sources  
will be disclosed in the 2015 Corporate 
responsibility report.)

switching to renewable energy is one  
of two main measures we have taken  
to reach our emissions reduction goals. 
Approximately 87% of the power we 
purchased in 2015 across the Group 
came from renewable energy sources. 
We are committed to raising this figure 
to 100%, but in some of the countries 
where we want to grow, reliable supplies 
of renewable energy are lacking. As a 
founding member of the rE100 initiative 
(therE100.org) we work together with  
a number of like-minded companies  
to improve this situation, by talking  
to policy-makers and regulators at  
the national and sub-national level.  
The rE100 group grew substantially  
in 2015 and now includes some of the 
largest companies in the world.

becoming more energy efficient in our 
own operations has been the second  
key measure of our Greenhouse Neutral 
programme. our goal is to continuously 
reduce energy intensity by at least 2% 
per year. recently we stepped up  
our efforts to create flexible office 
environments that offer our employees 
optimal working conditions while at the 
same time using space and resources 
more effectively. in combination with 
moving into more energy-efficient 
buildings, this enabled us to further 
reduce our energy intensity by 16% 
between 2013 and 2015. in 2015, the 
two measures contributed to workplace 
cost savings of 4%.
